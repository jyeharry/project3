# General Assembly Project 3

## Investment Calculator

See a demo [here](https://ga-project3.web.app/#/).

This was my final project for General Assembly. We allowed to use what he had learnt over the whole course to build whatever we wanted.

The motivation behind this particular app was my passion around the stock market and my lack of experience with ReactJS. I love to look at share price charts occasionally, so I wanted to build an app that could not only chart share prices, but also allow me to chart investments in whatever company you were looking at. As for the 'lack of experience with ReactJS' part, after learning a bit of React at GA, I found myself frustrated that I still didn't quite understand it. So I decided to throw myself into the deep-end by building my app with React.

### How it works

When the user enters a company's ticker symbol (American companies only) and presses search, two charts are displayed. One chart shows the company's share price history and can be toggled between different time periods, the other chart is accompanied with a form that allows the user to enter in their own custom investment amount, recurring investment and length of time, to graph what that invesment would look like.

## Future updates

I'd like to come back to this project and populate the rest of the page with financial data on the company that has been searched. The data would include market capitalisation, earnings, dividends etc.

Speaking of dividends, I'd also like to add the ability to toggle whether dividends are being reinvested into the company into the second chart, to further visualise what your investment would look like.

Lastly, I'd also like to improve my React skills so that I could further improve the overall app.
